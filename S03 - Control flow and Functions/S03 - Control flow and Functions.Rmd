### A. Basic `if`, `if else`, and `ifelse`

As we have learned about elementary data structures in R - and in spite of the fact that we still need to focus much more on data frames, {dplyr}, and powerfull data tables from {data.table} - we are about to move onto what any programming language is about: namely, programming. Session 03 is about control flow and functions in R: how to make R programs do what you want them to do. 

``` {r echo=T}
# clear all
rm(list=ls())

# Starting with one simple 'if'
num <- 2
if (num > 0) print("num is positive") # if condition num > 0 stands than print() is executed
```

An if statement in R always (1) starts with the keyword `if`, followed by (2) a *conditon* enclosed by parentheses, like `(num >0)`, and ending with a (3) line or a *block* of R code. The R interpreter will execute the code only if the condition is TRUE. As simple as that. 

Here's an example of a full *if - then - else construct* in R (note: there's really now *then* keyword in R):

``` {r echo=T}
# Sometimes 'if' has its 'else'
if (num > 0) {
  print("num is positive")
} else {
  print("num is negative")
}
```

The curly brackets (or braces) enclose one or more lines of R code into *blocks*. Important: in *if statements* in R, the `else` keyword must be found immediatelly after (on the same line!) the closing brace of the code block that would execute if the condition following `if` were true. Of course, if the condition following `if` evaluates to FALSE, the block following `else` will be executed.  

It is possible to chain multiple `if` statements by `if else`:

``` {r echo=T}
# Multiple 'else's are also possible
if (!is.numeric(num)) {
  print("this is not a number")
} else if (num > 0) {
  print("num is positive")
} else if (num < 0) {
  print("num is negative")
} else print("ZERO!")
```

R has a vectorized form for conditional expressions, `ifelse`:

``` {r echo=T}
# R Vectorized if-else
simple_vect <- c(1, 3, 12, NA, 2, NA, 4)
ifelse(is.na(simple_vect), "nothing here", "some number") # nothing here if it's
                                                          # NA or it's a number
```

The `ifelse` function operates in the following manner: it first evaluates its first argument, executes the code specified in its second argument if TRUE, and exectues the code specified in its second argument if FALSE. In the previous example, a call to `is.na` in `ifelse` returns a logical vector; wherever that vector is TRUE, the function will return `"nothing here"`, and `"some number"` otherwise. Obviously, the call to `ifelse` in this example returns a `character` vector.

***

### B. `for` loops

Looping... yes. We don't like looping a lot in R. It's a vector programming language that can get annoyingly slow upon imposing non-optimized loops on the interpreter to execute. However, sometimes one *really* needs to use them. Here's a simple `for` loop in R:

``` {r echo=T}
# For loops in R:
for (i in 1:10) print(i) # iterate in set of values
```

Now, the truth about the `for` loop in R: it can get slow. Very slow. You want to avoid doing this:

``` {r echo=T}
# Be aware that loops can be slow if
vec  <-  numeric()
system.time(
  for(i in seq_len(50000-1)) {
    some_calc <- sqrt(i/10)
    vec <- c(vec, some_calc) # this is what makes it slow
  }  
)
```

Spot the `vec <- c(vec, some_calc)` assignment in the `for` loop above. Every time this line of code executes, the R interpreter needs to allocate new memory for the resulting vector, copy the value of `vec`, executue `c(vec, some_calc)`, and asign... no. No, no, no. Try something else:

``` {r echo=T}
# This solution is slightly faster
iter <- 50000
vec <- numeric(length=iter) # this makes it faster...
system.time(
  for(i in seq_len(iter)) {
    some_calc <- sqrt(i/10)
    vec[i] <- some_calc # ...not this!
  }
)
```

Pre-allocating memory for `vec` by `vec <- numeric(length=iter)` is what will make this `for` loop run faster than the previous one. Always try to acquire as much processing speed as you can while in the loop; cutting out unnecessary assignments is only one way to do it:

``` {r echo=T}
# This solution is even more faster
iter <- 50000
vec <- numeric(length=iter) # not because of this...
system.time(
  for(i in seq_len(iter-1)) {
    vec[i] <- sqrt(i/10) # ...but this!
  }
)
```

***

### C. `for` loops vs. vectorized functions in R

The following chunk of code will produce 50,000 random numbers from the standard normal distribution (by using R's `rnorm()`, check it out: `?rnorm`):

``` {r echo=T}
# Another example how loops can be slow (loop vs vectorized function)
iter <- 50000

system.time(
  for (i in 1:iter) {
    vec[i] <- rnorm(n=1, mean=0, sd=1) # approach from previous example
  }
)

```

However, R's `rnorm()` is a vectorized function:

``` {r echo=T}
system.time(y <- rnorm(iter, 0, 1)) # but this is much much faster
```

as many, many other functions in R. Never forget about this great advantage that an R programmer has.

***

### D. More on loops

Yes, if you have wondered, R knows about the `while` loop:

``` {r echo=T}
# R also knows about while loop
r <- 1 # initializing some variable
while (r < 5) {
  print(r)
  r <- r + 1
}
```

Of course you can have nested loops in R:

``` {r echo=T}
# Loops can be nested
for(i in 1:5) { # outer loop
  for(j in 1:5) { # inner loop
    print(paste0(i,j)) # sample code
  }
}
```

If you're really, really bad in computer programming, especially in vector languages like R, you might find the existence of `break` and `next` handy :) - there it goes:

``` {r echo=T}
# Loops can be altered using break and next
for(i in 1:5) {
  if (i == 4) break # jump out of loop if condition is true
  print(i)
}

for(i in 1:5) {
  if (i == 4) next # just skip current iteration if condition is true
  print(i)
}
```

Finally, this is how to do a `repeat` loop in R:

``` {r echo=T}

# Nope, we didn't forget 'repeat' loop
i <- 1
repeat { # there is no condition...
  print(i)
  i <- i + 1
  if (i == 10) break # ... so, yes, you have to break it if you don't want an infinite loop
}
```

***

### E. Control flow with `switch`

In place of writing out a number of chained `if else` statements, sometimes `switch` can be very useful:

``` {r echo=T}
# And there's something called 'switch' :)
switch(2, "Data", "Science", "Dubai") # choose one option based on value
```

The previous example simply evaluates a constant (`2`) in the first argument to `switch`, picks the second among the remaining arguments, and returns it.

Of course, `switch` is more useful when based on variables. The following example takes `switchIndicator` - you can pick it's value by executing any of the first three lines - and acts accordingly to execute the respective block of R code:

``` {r echo=T}
# More on switch:
switchIndicator <- "Data"
switchIndicator <- "Science"
switchIndicator <- "Serbia"
# rare situations where you do not need to enclose strings by ' ', or " "
switch(switchIndicator,
       Data = {print(switchIndicator)},
       Science = {print(switchIndicator)
                    print(switchIndicator)},
       Serbia = {print(nchar(switchIndicator))}
)
```

**NOTE**: in `switch` we do not use neither `''` or `""` to enclose characters that correspond to our choice alternatives (i.e. `Data = {print(switchIndicator)}`, where `Data` is unquoted under `switch` in spite of being a constant of a `character` type). 

There's also an exception handling mechanism for `switch`. The following chunk of code will offer the `type` variable as a choice alternatives, but since `type = 4` is executed before `switch`, none of the alternatives from `cc` (of length == 3) will pop-up... what happens? Let' see:

``` {r echo=T}
# now:
type = 4
cc <- c("First", "Second", "Third")
switch(type,
       c1 = {print(cc[1])},
       c2 = {print(cc[2])},
       c3 = {print(cc[3])},
       {print("Beyond C...")} # default choice
)
```

"Beyond C..." is returned. The syntax of `switch` is somewhat nasty. While the alternatives have to be named (`c1`, `c2`, `c3` under `switch`), the exception (`{print("Beyond C...")}`) is not. However, the exception (the "default choice") is *numberd*: it is understood as the fourth alternative. Thus, if `type = 5` (change it yourself and try executing!), the `switch` statement will return **nothing** - meanining no error, and no warning. Be very, very careful.

**NOTE**: `switch` is known to be *faster* then chained `if else` statements.

### F. Introduction to Functions in R

In order to declare a function in R, we use the `function` keyword to list the function input arguments, while assigning a block of R code that the function executes:

``` {r echo=T}
# elementary function: a definition of a single argument function in R
fun <- function(x) x+10
fun(5)
```

For any given x, `fun()` now computes `x+10` and returns the value. Here's for an example of a two-parameter function declaration in R:

``` {r echo=T}
# Functions which takes two arguments
fun2 <- function(x,y) x+y
fun2(3,4)
```

For any given x, y, `fun2` now computes `x+y` and returns the sum. Of course, R has an in-built `sum()` function that operates over `numeric` vectors.

More complicated functions need to have their blocks enclosed by curly brackets, of course:

``` {r echo=T}
# Function using "{" and "}" to enclose multiple R expresions in the function body
fun <- function(x,y) {
  a <- sum(x)
  b <- sum(y)
  a-b
}
```

The previously defined function takes two **vector** arguments, `x` and `y`, sums up all elements of `x` (`a <- sum(x)`), sums up all elements of `y` (`b <- sum(y)`), and returns the difference of two sums (`a-b`). If no explicit usage of the keyword `return` is present, the function output is taken to be the result of code execution from the last line of the code in its body. Let's give it a try:

``` {r echo=T}
r <- c(5,4,3)
q <- c(1,1,1)
fun(r,q)
fun(c(5,4,3),c(1,1,1)) 
```

A function in R is a `function`:

``` {r echo=T}
# a function is a function:
class(fun)
is.function(fun)
is.function(log) # log is built-in

# printing function to acess their source code
fun
log # try: is.primitive(log) this one is written in C, 
    # belongs to the base package - it's "under the hood"
```

Some R functions, like `log()`, are **primitives**: they are written in C, and their code is found "under the hood" of {base} R. Here's an overview of some important primitive R functions:

``` {r echo=T}
# built in functions:
x <- 16
sqrt(x)
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
mean(x)
# watch for NAs in statistics (!)
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,NA)
mean(x)
mean(x, na.rm = T) # right!
median(x)
sd(x)
sum(x)
sum(x, na.rm = T) # a-ha!
```

Pay attention to the usage of the `na.rm` argument. By default, if R encounters an `NA` in a vector whose average value is `mean` attempting to compute, it will return `NA`. To drop all `NA` values from computation, one needs to specificy `na.rm = T`. The same holds for `median`, `sd`, and `sum` (but not for `sqrt`).

Functions in R can be nested and one needs to take care about lexical scoping in R which is quite intuitive:

``` {r echo=T}
# Lexical scoping in R + nested functions
x <- 1 # exists in the global environment
h <- function() {
  y <- 2 # exists in h()
  i <- function() {
    z <- 3 # exists in i()
    c(x, y, z) # calling z from i(), y from (h), and x from the global environment
  }
  i() # call i() from h()
}
h() # call h() from the global environment
```

A bit of practice and messing up argument names always comes good:

``` {r echo=T}
# Never do this in nested functions unless you have to:
# Messing up argument names...
rm(x, h)
x <- 1 # x exists in the global environment
h <- function(x) { # h(x) is declared in the global environment
  y <- x+1
  i <- function(x) { # i(x) exists in h(x)
    z <- x+2 # z exists in i()
    z
  }
  z <- i(x) # call i(x) from h(x)
  c(x,y,z) # execute in h(x) scope
}
h(x) # call h(x) from the global environment
```

***

### G. Some important functionals in R

Functionals in R take functions as their input. While you can write out your own functionals in R, here we focus on two very important in-built functionals: `lapply()` and `apply`.

`lapply()` takes a list and a function as its argument, and - as the name suggests - applies the function to each and every element in the input list, returning a list:

``` {r echo=T}
# lapply() example, Step 1. Here's a list:
list_1 <- list(c(1,2),
               c(4,5,6),
               c(7,8,9),
               c(10,11,12))
```

Now, we want to *apply* the following function:

``` {r echo=T}
# Step 2. This function:
my_fun <- function(x) {
  x[1]+x[2]-x[3]
}
```

to each and every element of `list_1`:

``` {r echo=T}
# Step 3. lapply() call:
res <- lapply(list_1, function(x) {
  x[1]+x[2]-x[3]
})
```

Don't forget that `lapply()` returns a list; if you need a vector, and most of the time you do, `unlist()` it:

```  {r echo=T}
# lapply returns a list; and I need a vector:
unlist(res) # to get a vector
rm(my_fun)
```

Somewhat similar to `lapply()` is `apply()` which operates over rows and columns of matrices (over margings of arrays, more generally). Define a matrix:

``` {r echo=T}
# Now say we have got a matrix
my_matr <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9),
                  nrow=3,
                  ncol=3)
```

We want to retrieve the sums of all rows of `my_matr`. Here's how we use `apply()` to accomplish that task:

``` {r echo=T}
# now, I want the sums of all rows:
rs_my_matr <- apply(my_matr, 1, function(x) {
  sum(x)
})
rs_my_matr
is.list(rs_my_matr)
```

Nice: `rs_my_matr`, the result of the `apply()` call in this example, is not a list. While `lapply()`, called over lists, returns a list, `apply()`, called over arrays (e.g. vectors and matrices), respectively, returns a vector.

Let's compute all column sums:

``` {r echo=T}
# sum of all columns:
cs_my_matr <- apply(my_matr, 2, function(x) {
  sum(x)
})
cs_my_matr
```

In the previous examples using `apply()` and `lapply()` we have consistently defined the functions on the fly; now, with in-built R functions, we do not need to do that:

``` {r echo=T}
# with existings functions such as sum(), this will do:
rs_my_matr_2 <- apply(my_matr, 1, sum)
rs_my_matr_2
cs_my_matr_2 <- apply(my_matr, 2, sum)
cs_my_matr_2
```

And to end our Session 03 on Control Flow and Functions in R, don't forget that R has a plenty of nicely vectorized, built-in functions to make your life in mathematical statistics and data science easier:

``` {r echo=T}
# But R makes your life really simple with these 2 built in functions
rowSums(my_matr)
colSums(my_matr)
```

***

## Readings for Session 04:

*Session 04 will focus on strings in R.* String processing is especially important today, since many data sources that we use in our everyday work as data scientists come in a form of unstructured textual data; string processing is there to help us impose necessary structures upon such data in order to make them ready for scientific modeling. If you have some knowlegde on regular expressions, maybe it's time for a refresher before the next session. Check this out: [https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/regex.html](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/regex.html), [Regular Expressions with The R Language](http://www.regular-expressions.info/rlanguage.html). If you have never heard of regular expressions before, huh, maybe: [Regular Expressions Quick Start](http://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html)

+ [Gaston Sanchez's "Handling and Processing Strings in R"](http://gastonsanchez.com/Handling_and_Processing_Strings_in_R.pdf) is probably the best that is out there. The text is lengthy, but again, string processing is a topic of serious extent in itself. Don't go for the whole Sanchez's work at this point. We will expose the fundamentals in our next Session 04 and point to further research.
